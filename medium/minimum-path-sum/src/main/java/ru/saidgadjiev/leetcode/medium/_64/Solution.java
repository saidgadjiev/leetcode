/**
 * Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.
 *
 * Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input:
 * [
 *   [1,3,1],
 *   [1,5,1],
 *   [4,2,1]
 * ]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
 *
 * Input:
 *  * [
 *  *   [1,3,1],
 *  *   [1,5,1],
 *  *   [4,2,1]
 *  * ]
